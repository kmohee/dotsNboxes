# dotsNboxes
The game of dots and boxes 

For our Haskell project, we decided to implement the dots and boxes game

This repo contains 4 files namely: 
1) displayGame.hs -- which deals with the graphics of the game (renders the game)
2) playDots.hs -- which deals with playing the game
3) dotsNboxes.hs which is our abstract representation of our dots, lines, boxes...
4) main.hs -- to run the game

To run the game, download the files and import them to GHCi then run the main file.
